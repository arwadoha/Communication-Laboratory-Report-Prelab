# Communication Laboratory Report

This repository contains the reports and prelab notes for various communication experiments conducted in the laboratory. The experiments cover a range of modulation and demodulation techniques used in communication systems.

## Experiments:

 Experiment #1: Normal Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation
 Experiment #2: Double-side and Single-side Band Modulation
 Experiment #4: Frequency Modulation
 Experiment #6: Pulse Amplitude Modulation (Sampling)
 Experiment #10: Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
 Experiment #11: Frequency and Phase Shift Keying

## Report Format
Each experiment should be documented in a report that includes the following sections:
1. **Title and Objective**: A clear description of the experiment and its goal.
2. **Theory**: The theoretical background and relevant equations.
3. **Procedure**: Detailed steps followed to perform the experiment.
4. **Results**: Observed experimental results with appropriate measurements.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and outcomes of the experiment.
6. **References**: List any textbooks, research papers, or online resources used for the experiments.
